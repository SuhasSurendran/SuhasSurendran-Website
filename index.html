        <p class="lead mb-4">The subject that inspires me most is filmmaking. I always had a passion for storytelling â€“ starting at five years of age, I created elaborate comic books about superheroes & ninjas. Towards the end of elementary school, I discovered game development. Over two years, I attended game design and development courses at DigiPen Institute of Technology, making my own board as well as digital games. The first time I was exposed to the subject of film was in eighth grade. I took film creation as my elective (the rumor was that the teacher allowed students who finished early to laze around). I completely enjoyed the class and made two short films that I still enjoy watching even today. After moving to California, I was required to take two elective film classes which I found them delightfully engaging â€“ I loved how they made me feel alive. Only then did I realize my passion & love for film and storytelling and how itâ€™s always been part of my life. (Looking back, I realize that I found comic books not as dynamic as I wanted, game-making a tad tedious, and movies to be perfect for my type of storytelling). I got experience as an editor at a temple where I volunteer, making informational videos. Over the summers, I got experience in screenwriting at SOCAPA, and film making at New York Film Academy. In the screenwriting course, I learned about character interaction, story arc, and script formats, writing several short scripts on my own. It gave me a strong insight on how people interpret and connect to a story. In the film making course, I played various roles as technician, cinematographer & editor, learning the collaborative environment of a movie set; as a film maker/director, I directed two short films which were shot in the Universal Studios backlot. Even now I am taking a college course on film at Cal Poly Pomona to further my knowledge of film. I intend to pursue filmmaking at UCR, exploring innovative ways of storytelling like virtual reality, thus making movies to become the expression of the viewer as well as the filmmaker. I believe that UCR will be the best environment for me to learn and create films, because it provides a space of collaboration, which I believe is the most important aspect of a movie production. A movie is a giant collage of many peopleâ€™s creativity and effort being shown as one giant image. The image that they create is a story that is the expression of everyone involved, including the viewer who will create their own impression of it. I also hope to use the incredibly powerful equipment that is provided at Drexel, including the ARRI ALEXA camera, which I know they use on professional movie sets.<br><br>
